# The extrapolation program — from mapped originals to a priced roster

**Maintainer's method, 2026-09-08, written down so it can be checked and executed.**
This is the plan that turns the reference map into the first applied balance numbers. Everything
in `docs/design/BALANCE_PROGRAM_PLAN.md` §0a still binds: weapon STRUCTURE before pricing.

## 0. The maintainer's proposal, in their words

> *"imagine that we will map all the existing units from TD and RA1 and then we extrapolate
> everything we cannot map, then we add RA1 Japan to the reference list and extrapolate our existing
> Japanese units from our 4 existing factions. And from those we will try to create the base band.
> Virtual baseline actors (at 100% and verifiers at 250% price) from our TD, RA1 and Japan factions.
> Then I'm sure we have all the units we need to fill out classes with the necessary data! And with
> that data established we can also more easily add the remaining factions to the reference?"*

**This is correct, it fixes a real problem, and one part of it is already built and unused.**
Two measurements settle it.

### 0.1 It is feasible — 26 of the 27 classes have members in those factions

Measured 2026-09-08 through `class_membership.classify()` over all 33 ledgers (700 classified rows):

```
class              TD+RA1  JP   all      class              TD+RA1  JP   all
anti_air_vehicle        3   1    14      light_tank              4   1    16
archer                  0   1     4      line_breaker            3   0    33
artillery               7   1    35      mbt                     8   2    51
artillery_tank          2   1    14      melee                   4   1    49
closecombat             1   0     5      missile_vehicle         4   0    14
commando                6   1    30      mortar                  1   0     5
dreadnought             0   0     5  ⛔  pure_sniper             2   0    16
epic_vehicle            4   2    24      rocket_trooper          6   0    45
fire_support            4   2    31      scout                   5   0    33
flying_infantry         0   1    11      scout_vehicle           5   2    52
grenadier               4   0     7      special_forces          4   1    16
heavy_infantry          5   2    41      support                14   2   115
heavy_sniper            2   0     3      tank_destroyer          1   0     5
high_tech_tank          6   2    26
```

**`dreadnought` is the only class with no member in TD, RA1 or Japan** — its five members are
StarCraft/naval. Every other class can be anchored from the factions the maintainer named. Japan
carries `archer` and `flying_infantry` on its own, which is a second reason to fold it in early
rather than treat it purely as a test.

⚠ Two earlier attempts at this measurement returned all-zeros and 8-zeros. Both were bugs in the
CHECK, not findings: membership is DERIVED from `design.subtype` when no explicit `class_anchor`
tag exists, so reading the tag alone reports `commando: 0` for a class with 30 members. Use
`class_membership.classify()`, never the raw field.

### 0.2 The virtual-anchor mechanism ALREADY EXISTS

```
tools/balance/fit_class.py --class <name> --spec hp,speed,range_wdist,damage,reload,cost0
    "virtual anchor ... a round-number model unit that need not exist in game (Tiger-style baseline)"
```

It has been in the tree since before this program was proposed, and **nothing uses it.** ⛔ Do not
design or build a virtual-anchor mechanism. `docs/TASK_INDEX.md` exists because this exact thing
was re-designed once already. What is missing is not the mechanism — it is the *inputs*.

---

## 1. Why a virtual anchor is the right answer, not a workaround

The 27 anchors are real actors today, and that is the source of the deadlock:

```
anchor actor OFF its ruled spec               23 of 27
satisfying the identity o0 = p0 = q0 = cost0   0 of 27
missing a fitted cost baseline                25 of 27
classes with LOW pricing residuals             0 of 27
```

A real anchor drifts every time someone edits that actor's yaml, and then the whole class reprices
underneath everyone. `mbt`'s spec says `hp0` 240,000 while `naxis_tiger` ships 100,000; the class
has been waiting on a "restat the baseline actor" step that has never run.

A virtual anchor cannot drift, because no yaml points at it. It is a round-number model unit
derived from evidence, and the evidence is exactly the thing three review rounds have been
hardening: the reference consensus for units that provably exist in every source.

**That is the whole argument. The originals are the best-evidenced numbers in the project, and the
anchor should be made of them rather than of whichever actor someone picked in July.**

---

## 2. The program, in five phases

Each phase has an owner, an artifact, and a gate. **No phase starts before its predecessor's gate.**

### Phase A — the original mappings, approved faction by faction

Owner: **Claude-Local** (TD, RA1) · **Astra** (RA2, TS — see §4).

One short report per faction: `td_gdi`, `td_nod`, `ra1_allies`, `ra1_soviets`. Originals only,
expansions listed separately and NOT part of the approval. The maintainer approves or rejects each
faction on its own, and the next phase starts for a faction the moment its originals are approved —
the four run in sequence, not behind the slowest.

GATE: maintainer approval, per faction, recorded in this document's §5 table.

### Phase B — the faction calibration, on the approved originals only

Owner: **Astra**. ⚠ `tools/balance/faction_extrapolate.py` (504 lines) **already implements the
exchange-rate method**: `k = geometric mean over pairs of (cameo_stat / reference_stat)`, per route
and per stat, with unpaired reference rows becoming virtual members at Cameo scale. Read it, run
`--report`, and write down what it does NOT yet do. Do not rebuild it.

For each approved faction and each stat (hp, speed, range, cost), compute `k` from the approved
STRONG/FAIR pairs only. One factor per faction per stat, with the pair count and the spread
attached — a `k` from three pairs is not the same evidence as a `k` from twenty, and the report
must say which.

GATE: every `k` has ≥3 backing pairs, or is marked `THIN` and excluded from Phase C.

### Phase C — extrapolate the expanded units of those four factions

Owner: **Astra**. Place each expanded unit at **class anchor × tech tier × faction factor**, and let
the formula compute the price from the placed stats. This is the first real test of the method, and
it is deliberately run on factions where we CAN check the answer: an expansion sitting next to
approved originals is easy for a human to sanity-check.

GATE: maintainer eyeballs one faction's expanded roster and says the numbers are not absurd.

### Phase D — Japan

Owner: **Astra**. Japan has no reference data at all, which is the point: it is the honest test of
whether extrapolation works where nothing can be checked against a source. Run the same Phase B/C
machinery with Japan's `k` derived from the four factions rather than from references.

⚠ Japan is also *evidence*, not only a test — it carries `archer` and `flying_infantry` members that
TD and RA1 do not. Once its roster is placed, it feeds Phase E.

GATE: maintainer reviews the Japanese roster. If it is sane, the method is proven for every
expansion unit in the game.

### Phase E — the virtual anchors, and the first applied numbers

Owner: **Astra**, signed by the **maintainer**.

For each of the 26 covered classes, derive the virtual anchor from that class's TD/RA1/Japan
members after Phases A–D:

1. **`hp0`, `speed0`, `range0_wdist`, `cost0`** — from the class's members in those factions,
   preferring reference-backed originals, rounded onto the nice-number grid (`docs/DESIGN.md`, the
   nice-number law; damage on the **100** grid, `formula.DAMAGE_STEP`).
2. **The identity `o0 = p0 = q0 = cost0` must hold by construction.** It is a virtual unit — if the
   identity does not hold, the spec is wrong, not the actor. This is the single cleanest advantage
   over a real anchor and it must be asserted, not hoped for.
3. **The verifier at 250%.** A model unit at 2× hp, 2× dps, 2.5× cost. ⛔ Baseline and verifier must
   share the TechTier bucket AND `K`, or the 2.5× identity breaks — this has bitten before.
4. Feed it straight to `fit_class.py --class X --spec hp,speed,range_wdist,damage,reload,cost0` and
   report the residual distribution against the class's real members.
5. ⛔ **`dps0` is still excluded** while W24 moves (231 weapons still stack 2+ mains). The spec's
   `damage,reload` fields are the model unit's own, not a target for any real weapon.

⛔ **`dreadnought` has no member in these factions.** Do not invent one. Report it as the single
class that needs a different source and let the maintainer decide — probably after RA2/TS mapping
gives it naval evidence.

GATE: maintainer signs. Then, and only then, `extract_stats` → ledger → `apply_balance --confirm`
on the signed classes.

---

## 3. Why this also makes the remaining factions easier — the maintainer's last point, confirmed

Yes, and the mechanism is worth stating precisely. Once the anchors are virtual and evidence-backed:

* a new faction does not need its own anchor argument — it needs one `k` per stat, which is a much
  smaller and much more checkable claim;
* a faction with NO reference source (Japan, and most of the invented factions) is placed by class
  anchor × tier × a `k` borrowed from a sibling faction, which is exactly Phase D;
* the anchors stop moving when someone edits a unit, so adding a faction can no longer reprice an
  existing one.

That last property is the real prize. Today, restatting `naxis_tiger` silently reprices all 51 `mbt`
members. After Phase E, it reprices nothing.

---

## 4. Astra's part, and whether it is possible without the game folders

**It is.** The reference corpus is committed: `docs/reference/ini_corpus.json` (11,870 rows) and
`docs/design/ORIGINAL_UNITS_PEER_OPENRA.md` (2,583 rows). Nothing in the TD/RA1 mapping process
touched a local game install — every input is in the repo. Astra can run the identical pipeline
(`assign_references.py` → `reference_targets.py` → `build_reference_report.py`) for RA2 and TS.

**Maintainer's ruling 2026-09-08: Astra owns the RA2 and TS reference maps.** Same tools, different
factions, no collision with Claude-Local's TD/RA1 work.

⛔ **Read-only on the reference producers.** Astra reports mappings and hands over patches;
Claude-Local lands changes to `assign_references.py`, `reference_distribution.py`,
`faction_routes.py`, `reference_targets.py`. Five agents colliding in that tree is what cost a week.

RA2 has the most sources (Romanov's Vengeance, Mental Omega, CnC Reloaded, Rise of the East, RA2
Reborn, Valiant Shades). ⚠ **Whether Romanov's Vengeance is the RA2 authority is an OPEN maintainer
question** — it carries 729 buildable units, more than RA2 + YR ever shipped, and it is 104 of the
119 unclaimed "originals". `audit_original_coverage` currently exempts it from the O2 ratchet. That
exemption is a placeholder and must be DELETED once ruled, never raised.

---

## 5. Approval ledger

Filled in as the maintainer approves. Nothing downstream of a row may start until it says APPROVED.

| faction | originals report | approved | phase B `k` | phase C expanded | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `td_gdi` | — | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | |
| `td_nod` | — | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | |
| `ra1_allies` | — | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | |
| `ra1_soviets` | — | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ⚠ the `ra1_soviets` RENAME is rejected; do not confuse it with the mapping |
| `japan` | n/a — no reference source | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | Phase D; also supplies `archer` + `flying_infantry` evidence |
| `ra2_allies` | Astra | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | |
| `ra2_soviets` | Astra | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | |
| `ts_gdi` | Astra | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | |
| `ts_nod` | Astra | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | |

## 6. What would make this plan wrong

Stated up front so it can be checked rather than discovered late:

1. **If the four original factions are not representative of the game's power band**, every anchor
   derived from them is centred wrong. Test: compare each class's TD/RA1/Japan member stats against
   the class's full membership BEFORE signing. A class whose TD/RA1 members sit in one tail is a
   class whose virtual anchor will be biased, and it must be flagged, not signed.
2. **If `k` is computed from too few pairs**, a faction factor is noise with a decimal point. Hence
   the Phase B gate at ≥3 pairs.
3. **If W24 moves a class's weapons after its anchor is signed**, the `K` that priced it changes.
   Hence `dps0` stays out and the anchors are HP/speed/range/cost only.
4. **If the reference consensus itself is wrong**, everything downstream inherits it. That is what
   the faction-by-faction approval in Phase A is for, and it is why shape-only matches were deleted
   entirely rather than kept as weak evidence.
